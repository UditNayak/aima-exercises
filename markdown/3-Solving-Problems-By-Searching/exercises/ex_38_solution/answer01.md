## Answers

### 1. Deriving the MST Heuristic from a Relaxed Version of the TSP

The MST heuristic for the TSP is derived from a relaxed version of the problem where instead of finding a tour (a path that visits all cities and returns to the start), we only find a minimum-spanning tree (MST) that connects all cities. 

To derive the MST heuristic:
- **Relaxation**: Consider the problem where we need to connect all cities but not necessarily return to the starting city. This relaxed version is equivalent to finding an MST of the graph formed by the cities and their pairwise distances.
- **Heuristic Derivation**: The cost of the MST provides a lower bound on the cost of the optimal TSP tour. This is because any valid tour must span all the cities and hence must include at least the edges of the MST, which is the minimum sum of edges connecting all cities. Thus, the MST cost is used as an estimate or heuristic for the TSP.

### 2. Showing that the MST Heuristic Dominates Straight-Line Distance

To show that the MST heuristic dominates the straight-line distance heuristic:
- **Straight-Line Distance Heuristic**: This heuristic estimates the tour cost by assuming a straight-line path between cities. It is typically less accurate because it ignores the actual network of paths and only considers the direct Euclidean distance.
- **Comparison**: The MST heuristic dominates the straight-line distance heuristic because:
  - The MST heuristic is guaranteed to be at least as large as the straight-line distance between cities (considering any optimal tour will involve distances that are at least as large as the MST).
  - The MST heuristic provides a lower bound on the tour cost, while the straight-line distance might underestimate the cost significantly by ignoring the network of paths that would be used in a true tour.

### 3. Problem Generator for Random TSP Instances

To generate instances of the TSP where cities are represented by random points in the unit square:

```python
import numpy as np

def generate_random_tsp(num_cities):
    """
    Generates a TSP instance with cities as random points in the unit square.
    
    Parameters:
    num_cities (int): Number of cities to generate.
    
    Returns:
    np.array: A matrix where element [i, j] represents the distance between city i and city j.
    """
    # Generate random points in the unit square
    points = np.random.rand(num_cities, 2)
    
    # Compute the distance matrix
    distances = np.sqrt(np.sum((points[:, np.newaxis] - points)**2, axis=2))
    
    return distances
```

### 4. Efficient Algorithm for Constructing the MST

One efficient algorithm for constructing the MST is Kruskal's Algorithm. This algorithm can be used as follows:

1. Sort: Sort all edges of the graph in ascending order of their weights.
2. Union-Find: Use a union-find data structure to add edges to the MST, ensuring no cycles are formed.
3. Construct MST: Add edges to the MST in increasing order of their weight until the MST spans all vertices.
   
##### Implementation in Python:
```python
import numpy as np

def kruskal_mst(distances):
    """
    Computes the MST of a graph using Kruskal's algorithm.
    
    Parameters:
    distances (np.array): The distance matrix representing the graph.
    
    Returns:
    float: Total weight of the MST.
    """
    num_cities = len(distances)
    edges = [(distances[i, j], i, j) for i in range(num_cities) for j in range(i + 1, num_cities)]
    edges.sort()
    
    parent = list(range(num_cities))
    rank = [0] * num_cities
    
    def find(u):
        if parent[u] != u:
            parent[u] = find(parent[u])
        return parent[u]
    
    def union(u, v):
        root_u = find(u)
        root_v = find(v)
        if root_u != root_v:
            if rank[root_u] > rank[root_v]:
                parent[root_v] = root_u
            elif rank[root_u] < rank[root_v]:
                parent[root_u] = root_v
            else:
                parent[root_v] = root_u
                rank[root_u] += 1
    
    mst_weight = 0
    for weight, u, v in edges:
        if find(u) != find(v):
            union(u, v)
            mst_weight += weight
    
    return mst_weight
```

## Conclusion

- The MST heuristic provides a useful approximation for the TSP by estimating the lower bound of the tour cost.
- It dominates the straight-line distance heuristic due to its consideration of network paths.
- The provided problem generator and MST algorithm can be used to generate TSP instances and solve them efficiently.
